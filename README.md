# Cadasta SDK

This is an SDK for interacting with the [Cadasta Platform](https://cadasta.org) using Python.  It is written to support both Python 2.7+ and Python 3.


## Getting Started

The intention for this module is to make it easier to interact with the Cadasta Platform so that you build tooling quickly.  It is recommended that you familiarize yourself with the Cadasta Platform [[docs]](https://docs.cadasta.org/) and the Cadasta API [[docs]](https://cadasta.github.io/api-docs/),[[interactive-docs]](http://demo.cadasta.org/api/v1/docs/).
